#### How to build AMI using Packer
1. Go to the packer folder

2. Initialize packer
   ```shell
      packer init .
    ```
3. Validate Packer
   ```shell
      packer validate .
    ```
4. Format Packer files
   ```shell
      packer fmt
    ```
5. Build Packer

    ```
Note : If you want you can add a variables.auto.pkvars.hcl file if you want to provide custom variables other than the default values provided. Additionally, You can `source .venv` which exports the DB Environment variables and the packer IAM user access keys.
